                <div class="main-block-text"><h2>Piebot</h2>Piebot is by far my most extensive project to date. It has been a hobby of mine, and has been a multi-year long journey with two complete rewrites.<br><br>Piebot is written in Node.JS and is a Discord application, which is often called a chatbot. Discord, for those unaware, is a server-based chatting platform online where communities can form. A chatbot is similar to a user on the platform and can perform actions when a user types a command. Piebot started out as a simple chatbot and has progresisvely grown over time.<br><br>While the first iteration was fairly basic, and frankly a mess, the newest iteration is the most feature complete and organized it has been. My coding skills have grown over the years and it has been translated into making Piebot better, hence the multiple rewrites.<br><br>Piebot's strongest feature is its database connection, using MongoDB. The database handles multiple things, one of which is the ability to store unique info for each user on Discord interacting with the bot. It is used to simulate an economy of sorts on the server. The database also allows for users to create custom reminders, of which the bot will remind them at the given time and date. The bot also connects to another version of the bot, PiebotTTV (Made for the platform Twitch), and allows for communication between the two applications.</div>
